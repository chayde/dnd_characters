---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### ✅ ALWAYS REMEMBER
- **You attack THREE times per turn** (Attack action x2 with Nick + Dual Wielder bonus action)
- **Conjure Minor Elementals lasts 10 minutes** - You can pre-cast it if you know a fight is coming
- **Primal Strike adds 1d8 cold to ONE attack per turn** - Always use this!
- **Large Form must come BEFORE Enlarge** - Wrong order = you only become Large, not Huge
- **Weapon Mastery is always on:**
  - Hand Axe (Vex): Hit = advantage on next attack against that target
  - Light Hammer (Nick): Make extra attack as part of Attack action (already built into your 3 attacks)

### ⚠️ DON'T FORGET
- **Concentration:** Only one concentration spell at a time
  - Conjure Minor Elementals vs Enlarge/Reduce (can't have both!)
  - Wrath of the Sea does NOT require concentration (it's a feature, not a spell)
- **Wrath of the Sea uses Wild Shape charges** - You have 3 total
- **Large Form is 1/long rest** - Don't waste it on trivial encounters
- **Frost's Chill is limited** - Only 4 uses per long rest
- **Two-Weapon Fighting Style:** Your Light Hammer bonus action adds STR modifier to damage (already included in calculations)

### 🎯 TACTICAL TIPS
- **Pre-cast Conjure Minor Elementals** before fights if you have 1 minute warning
- **Use Vex mastery strategically:** Attack with Hand Axe first to get advantage on your second Hand Axe attack
- **Save your 4th-level slots for Conjure Minor Elementals** - it's your best damage multiplier
- **Wrath of the Sea pushes 15 ft.** - Use it to shove enemies off cliffs or into hazards
- **Going Huge takes 2 turns of setup** - Plan accordingly, or just use damage mode
- **Guidance is free** - Cast it on allies making important checks (lockpicking, Perception, etc.)
- **Wild Shape for scouting:** Turn into an Owl and fly ahead to scout, then report back
