It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the incapacitated condition.
    *   When you manifest the emanation and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the emanation. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 14) or take cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

You don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative.
    *   **Note:** With Two-Weapon Fighting style, you DO add your ability modifier.

## Appearance & Personality

### Hrimgar's Appearance

**Physique:**
Hrimgar stands at an imposing **7 feet tall** even in his natural form, with a broad, muscular frame weighing approximately **300 pounds**. His build is that of a warrior who has spent years surviving in harsh, frozen environments—thick arms, powerful legs, and a barrel chest that speaks to both strength and endurance. When he activates **Large Form**, he swells to **14 feet tall** and nearly **2,400 pounds**, towering over most creatures. And when **Enlarge** is combined with Large Form, he becomes a **28-foot colossus** weighing close to **19,000 pounds**—a true frost giant.

**Skin & Markings:**
His skin is a **pale, greyish-blue**, like ice on the verge of melting, etched with darker blue and white **ritual scars and tattoos** that resemble cracking ice, frost patterns, and ancient druidic runes. These markings glow faintly with a cold, blue light when he casts spells or uses his Frost Giant ancestry abilities. His skin is cold to the touch, and frost sometimes forms on his beard and hair in combat.

**Eyes:**
Hrimgar's eyes are **icy blue**, almost crystalline, with no visible pupils—like looking into the heart of a glacier. When he uses **Frost's Chill** or **Wrath of the Sea**, his eyes glow with an intense, cold radiance, and his breath becomes visible as freezing mist.

**Hair:**
His hair is **long and white**, streaked with pale blue, worn loose or tied back in a warrior's braid. His beard is thick and heavy, often decorated with small bones, iron rings, or shards of ice that never melt. Both hair and beard appear perpetually dusted with frost.

**Attire:**
Hrimgar wears **half-plate armor** that has been weathered and scarred by countless battles in frozen wastelands. The metal is dark iron, inscribed with runes of winter and protection. Over his armor, he wears a **heavy fur cloak** made from the pelt of a northern beast, which billows dramatically when he grows to Large or Huge size.

At his belt hangs his **+1 hand axe**, its blade etched with frost runes, and his **+1 light hammer**, compact but brutal, with a head carved to resemble a shard of ice. Around his waist is the **Belt of Hill Giant Strength**, a wide leather strap reinforced with iron plates and adorned with the symbol of a mountain wreathed in storm clouds.

**The Transformation (Large Form + Enlarge):**
When Hrimgar activates **Large Form**, his body surges with power. His muscles swell, his height doubles, and the air around him grows bitterly cold. Frost spreads from his feet, and his breath becomes a freezing fog.

When he follows this with **Enlarge**, the transformation is awe-inspiring and terrifying:
*   He grows to **28 feet tall**, his shadow blotting out the sun.
*   His weapons grow proportionally, and each swing creates gusts of freezing wind.
*   The ground trembles beneath his footsteps, and enemies must crane their necks to meet his gaze.
*   His voice becomes a booming rumble, like an avalanche echoing through a canyon.

**The Blizzard (Conjure Minor Elementals + Wrath of the Sea):**
When Hrimgar casts **Conjure Minor Elementals** and activates **Wrath of the Sea**, he becomes a walking storm:
*   **Swirling shards of ice, snow, and frozen wind** spiral around him in a 15-foot radius.
*   The temperature drops drastically, and the ground beneath him frosts over.
*   Enemies caught in the aura are battered by icy blasts, taking cold damage and being hurled backward.
*   His weapons trail freezing mist, and each strike explodes with frost.

He looks less like a mortal warrior and more like a **force of nature**—an elemental embodiment of winter's wrath.

---

### Personality Traits

*   **Stoic and Unyielding:** Hrimgar speaks little, but when he does, his words carry the weight of glaciers. He does not waste breath on empty threats or boasts.
*   **Protector of the Weak:** Despite his fearsome appearance, Hrimgar has a strong sense of duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves. His time as a farmer taught him the value of nurturing life, even in the harshest conditions.
*   **Respectful of Nature:** As a druid, Hrimgar reveres the natural world, especially the harsh, frozen environments of the north. He sees winter not as cruel, but as a necessary force that tests and tempers the strong.
*   **Slow to Trust, Loyal to the End:** Hrimgar does not give his trust easily, but once earned, his loyalty is unshakable. Betray him, however, and you will face the full fury of winter.

## Roleplaying Notes

### Hrimgar's Voice & Mannerisms
*   **Voice:** Deep, rumbling, and slow—like distant thunder rolling over frozen mountains. He speaks in short, declarative sentences.
*   **Speech Pattern:** Hrimgar rarely uses contractions. He speaks formally but not pretentiously. Example: "I will not allow this." Not: "I won't let this happen."
*   **Mannerisms:**
    *   He has a habit of resting his hand on his axe when thinking.
    *   He tends to look people in the eye for long, uncomfortable moments—not to intimidate, but because he's assessing their character.
    *   When frustrated, frost visibly forms on his beard and breath.

### Hrimgar's Beliefs
*   **"The cold does not lie. It reveals what endures."** - Hrimgar believes that hardship is a crucible that reveals one's true nature.
*   **"Winter is not cruel. Winter is honest."** - He sees the harsh aspects of nature as necessary and fair, not malicious.
*   **"I am the frost that lingers after the storm. I do not relent."** - Once Hrimgar commits to a cause or a person, he is immovable.

### Bonds & Ideals
*   **Bond:** Hrimgar once failed to protect his village from a raid during a harsh winter. Though he survived and grew stronger, the memory haunts him. He will never allow others to suffer for his weakness again.
*   **Ideal:** Strength is a duty, not a privilege. Those who are strong must protect those who are not.
*   **Flaw:** Hrimgar struggles to forgive himself for past failures. He can be overly harsh on himself and expects the same level of endurance from others, sometimes forgetting that not everyone shares his resilience.

## Tactical Reminders

### Opening Turn Options
1.  **Maximum Damage Mode:** Conjure Minor Elementals (action) + Wrath of the Sea (bonus action). Next turn: Attack 3x with +6d8 cold damage total.
2.  **Become Huge Mode:** Large Form (bonus action) + Enlarge (action). Next turn: Attack 3x with +1d4 damage, dominate Strength checks.
3.  **Ambush/Surprise:** If you have 1 minute before combat, pre-cast Conjure Minor Elementals and walk into battle as a blizzard.

### Combat Priorities
*   Use **Vex mastery** strategically: Attack with Hand Axe first to gain advantage on your second Hand Axe attack.
*   Add **Primal Strike** (1d8 cold) to one attack per turn—usually your Light Hammer attack.
*   Save **Frost's Chill** (4/long rest) for fast enemies or when you need burst damage.
*   Use **Wrath of the Sea** to push enemies off cliffs, into hazards, or away from squishier allies.

### Defensive Play
*   You have no reaction abilities at this level—position carefully.
*   If someone is dying, use **Cure Wounds** (action) or **Healing Word** (if you had it prepared as a bonus action).
*   After combat, use **Goodberry** for efficient healing (10 HP for a 1st-level slot).
