00:08 Hello everyone and welcome back to Rules is Written Character Builds. This December, I wanted to do something 
00:13 special and try to bring the classic YouTube Vlogmas tradition of one video per day until Christmas to my channel. 
00:20 So, introducing Buildmiss. I'll be releasing one new build every weekday until Christmas. And on Christmas Day, 
00:27 we'll be doing a double feature. Since this adds up to exactly 20 videos, I thought it would be fun to have each 
00:32 episode be the corresponding level with the builds designed to operate at that exact level. So, today we are on episode

00:40 9, and I had such a good time making the fire giant build earlier this year that I thought I would try that aesthetic 
00:45 again, but this time with the fire giants's frigid cousins, the frost giants. Now, to achieve this goal, we'll 
00:52 be combining the druid class with two levels of ranger and putting the whole thing on top of a Goliath for our 
00:58

species. So, introducing Buildmiss episode 9, the frost giant. With these videos, I focus only on

01:13 features that either play into the character fantasy or are necessary for the mechanical play of the build. For 
01:19 this reason, you'll often see me skip over class features. That's just me trying to stay on course and keep these 
01:24 videos to a reasonable length. I also do my best to play into the backwards compatible nature of the 2024 rule set. 
01:32 So, I will use content from prior to the 2024 release as long as that content hasn't been reprinted. Now, let's dive 
01:39 in. Our ability scores are a bit tricky with this one. Since we're a giant, I want to be a strength build, but Ranger

01:44 requires a 13 dexterity to multiclass. I almost went with Dex build just for efficiency sake. But I can't swallow the 
01:51 idea of a giant who isn't first and foremost strong. So, we're just going to eat that dexterity requirement, let it 
01:56

help us with our medium armor, and use strength for all of our attack and damage roles. Here's our spread. 
02:02 Strength of 15, dexterity of 14, constitution of 12, intelligence of eight, wisdom of 13, and charisma of 10. 
02:09 Equipment wise, we're going to be using medium armor and some light weapons, specifically the hand axe and the light

02:14 hammer. For our background, we are going with the classic farmer for the tough feet. Two extra hit points per level, 
02:20 aka 18 extra hit points for this build. Using the background ability score increases will increase our strength by 
02:27 two for a 17 and our wisdom by one for a 14. So, to achieve our level 9 frost giant, we are going to take seven levels 
02:35 of druid and two levels of ranger. And we're going to be starting in the ranger class. For our species, it's going to be 
02:40 Goliath, and we're going to take the frost giant giant ancestry. Let's take a look at the features that keep this

02:46

build cool. Large form, giants ancestry, weapon mastery, fighting style, wild shape, the circle of sea subclass, the 
02:53 enlarge reduced spell, the dual wielder feet, elemental fury, and conjure minor elementals. Now, from our species, we 
03:00 get the large form feature. Starting at character level five, you can change your size to large as a bonus action if 
03:06 you're in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it. No action required. 
03:12 For that duration, you have an advantage on strength checks and your speed increases by 10 feet. Once you use this

03:18 trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. If we are calling ourselves a frost giant, we need to be 
03:24 able to get big. And this is our first of two abilities to achieve that. Additionally, from our species, we chose 
03:30 frost giant for our giant ancestry. This gives us the frost's chill feature. Choose one of the following benefits. A 
03:36

supernatural boon from your ancestry. You can use the chosen benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus 
03:42 and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal

03:48 damage to it, you can also deal 1d6 cold damage to that target and reduce its speed by 10 ft until the start of your 
03:56 next turn. So, we are taking our first two levels in ranger. I like this choice for the extra starting hit points as 
04:03 well as the proficiency and strength and dexterity saving throws. First off, we're going to take mastery in both the 
04:08 hand axe and the light hammer. I think these are the most aesthetically pleasing dual wielding weapons for our 
04:13 build. The light hammer only deals 1d4 damage, but we need it for the nick mastery. If you prefer to take the

04:19 scimitar for its d6 damage, I wouldn't blame you. However, I wanted to go axe and hammer for our frost giant. So, as I 
04:26

said, light hammer gives us nick. When you make the extra attack of the light property, you can make it as part of the 
04:31 attack action instead of as a bonus action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn. On our action, we 
04:37 can make two attacks thanks to this. And then the handax, our higher damage option, uses the Vex mastery. If you hit 
04:43 a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll 
04:48 against that creature before the end of your next turn. We're going to use this attack to give our nick attack

04:54 advantage. Going right along with these features, ranger level two gives us a fighting style, and we need to take two 
04:59 weapon fighting. when you make an extra attack as a result of using a weapon that has the light property, you can add 
05:05 your ability modifier to the damage of the attack if you aren't already adding it to the damage. Just like that, our 
05:10

little light hammer now benefits from our strength modifier for a total of 1d4 + 4. Now, that's it for ranger. Now, 
05:18 we'll head into druid to start locking down our icy powers. Druid gives us the wild shape feature. I don't really see

05:24 this character being one who does a lot of wild shaping. However, our subclass will give us a different way to spend 
05:31 those wild shaped charges. So, I just wanted to note that we have a total of three wild shaped charges with our seven 
05:36 levels of druid. Now, as for subclass, we're going with circle of the sea. It gives us a lot of nice cold damage and 
05:43 storms spells, but we're going to need to reflavor it a little bit. Uh, instead of focusing on the sea aspect as though 
05:50 we were like a storm giant, we're going to call all these powers more like a northern tundra/

05:56 snowstorm frost magic kind of vibe. The feature that we get at this point is called wrath of the sea. As a bonus 
06:02

action, you can expend a use of your wild shape to manifest a 5-ft emanation that takes the form of ocean spray that 
06:08 surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it. No action required. Manifest it again or have the 
06:14 incapacitated condition. When you manifest the emanation and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can 
06:20 choose another creature you can see in the emanation. The target must succeed on a constitution saving throw against 
06:25 your spell DC or take cold damage and if the creature is large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 ft away from you. To

06:33 determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your wisdom modifier, minimum of one. Think of this emanation 
06:39 as more of a swirling mass of frozen air as opposed to ocean spray. Now, we'll soon be getting a bonus action weapon 
06:46 attack. So, the damaging bonus action from Wrath of the Sea is never going to be our most efficient damage option. 
06:52

However, the push is nice utility, so don't be afraid to use this if damage isn't your number one goal in a given 
06:59 fight. Also, since the bonus action attack requires us to take the attack action, if we're ever using our action

07:05 for something else, like casting a spell or activating a feature, we can still use this bonus action to get some damage 
07:11 in that round. Also, at this point, we get our second level spells from druid, and we're going to take enlarge reduce. 
07:16 When we cast this spell and use the enlarge option on ourselves, we will increase in size by one size category. 
07:23 Now, this spell costs an action to activate. So, we can use it the same turn as large form since large form is a 
07:30 bonus action to bring our size from medium all the way up to huge. But remember that the large form feature

07:36 makes you large if you aren't already, whereas enlarge increases your size by one category. So you must use a large 
07:42

form first to become large and then enlarge to become huge. If you do this process backwards, then enlarge reduce 
07:50 will make you large and large form won't increase your size because you're already large. Anyway, this spell also 
07:56 causes your weapon attacks to deal 1d4 extra damage. So it's pretty useful for a dual wielder. Speaking of dual 
08:02 wielding, that leads us to our level four ability score increase, feet. And we are taking the dual wielder feet.

08:08 Increase your strength dexterity score by one to a maximum of 20. When you take the attack action on your turn and 
08:13 attack with a weapon that has the light property, you can make one extra attack as a bonus action later on the same turn 
08:20 with a different weapon, which must be a melee weapon that lacks the two-handed property. You don't add your ability 
08:25 modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. We're going to bump our strength to 18 with 
08:31

this feat for the plus4 modifier. Now, thanks to this feat, we can attack with our bonus action, meaning we'll be 
08:37 making three attacks per turn. Attack, action, nick attack, dual wielder, bonus action, attack. Now, the last two

08:43 features that we're going to talk about both come at Druid level seven, our final level for this build. First up is 
08:49 Elemental Fury. This gives us two options to choose from. Let's see if we can guess which one we're going with. 
08:54 The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice. Potent 
09:00 spellcasting. Add your wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any druid cantrip or primal strike. Once on each 
09:07 of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, using a weapon or a beast forms attack and wild shape, you

09:14 can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage. Choose when you hit. We are 
09:19

going to be going with primal strike. That way, we can add 1d8 cold damage to one attack per turn. And lastly, we are 
09:25 going to be choosing the conjure minor elementals spell. Now that we have access to fourth level druid spells, you 
09:32 conjure spirits from the elemental plains that flit around you in a 15t emanation for the duration. Until the 
09:38 spell ends, any attack you make deals an extra 2d8 damage when you hit a creature in the emanation. The damage is acid,

09:46 cold, fire, or lightning. Your choice when you make the attack. In addition, the ground in the emanation is difficult 
09:52 terrain for your enemies. The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above four. Now, this spell isn't 
09:58 nearly as broken as it once was, but it's still capable of being the defining damage boost for a build like this. 
10:04 Since we are making three attacks per turn, this will let us add a total of 6d8 cold damage to those attacks every 
10:10

turn. Note though that this spell does require an action to cast, so it will take an entire turn of setup. However,

10:17 it does have a 10minute duration, so it's definitely possible to pre-cast it if you know a fight is coming relatively 
10:24 soon. And that's all of the features. So, let's talk about how we pilot our frost giant. This is another of those 
10:30 basic spell sword builds. We get into battle, spend our first turn buffing ourselves, and then we go to work every 
10:36 turn after that, making as many attacks as we can to cash in on the extra damage. With this build, there are 
10:42 basically two different paths to take when buffing yourself depending on what you need. First is the maximum damage

10:48 path. Turn one, use your action to cast conjure minor elementals. Then use your bonus action to activate Wrath of the 
10:54 Sea and hit somebody for 2d6 cold damage. The aesthetic here is pretty sick. Conjure Minor Elementals surrounds 
11:00

you in elemental energy. We'll focus on cold for our aesthetic, and Wrath of the Sea gives you an emanation of cold 
11:06 energy. So, we're going to be like a walking winter storm. Every turn after that, you use the action and the bonus 
11:12 action to make weapon attacks, three in total. The two handax attacks are going to deal 1d6 slashing and 2d8 cold plus

11:19 four. The light hammer attack will be on the smaller d4 damage dice, but we have our elemental fury feature, so we can 
11:25 throw another d8 cold on that one to make it 1d4 and 3d8 cold plus four. And don't forget to throw out your giant 
11:33 species feature, frost's chill, for an extra 1d6 cold damage on an attack. proficiency bonus number of times per 
11:41 long rest. That's the damage build. Or if the situation doesn't call for more damage, but instead your party needs an 
11:47 absolutely massive frontlininer, you can go with the giant size option. Turn one, use your bonus action for large form,

11:54

becoming large, and your action to cast enlarge reduce, choosing enlarge to make yourself huge. Assuming that your 
12:00 Goliath has an average build around 7 feet tall and 300 lb. Once you bring yourself up to huge, you'll be around 28 
12:07 feet tall and 19,000 pounds. And what's even better is because of our large form species trait, we count as one size 
12:15 larger when determining our carrying or lifting capacity. So we can lift and move objects as though we were 
12:22 gargantuan. With an 18 strength, that comes out to a lifting capacity of 4,320 lb. That's very nearly 2 metric tons. I

12:33 doubt there's any strength check you'll come across that can't be autopassed when you tell your DM that you can lift 
12:38 two tons. And that's the build. Thanks so much for tuning in to another episode of Buildmiss. Let me know what you think 
12:44 of the Frost Giant in the comments down below. And come back every weekday until Christmas for another original character 
12:50 build. Thanks again and I'll see you all tomorrow.
