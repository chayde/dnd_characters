**Voice:** Deep, measured, colder than before. He speaks in short sentences.

**Quirks & Habits:**

- Protective of Inara, his link to his former life.
- Seeks to understand what service to Auril truly means.

**Flaws:**
- Emotion is vulnerability—refuses to show warmth or weakness.
- Still figuring out his place in the world; uncertain of Auril's full purpose for him.

---

### Backstory: From Farmer to Frostbound Paladin

#### The Warm Past (Levels 1–3)

Kram Gor was born into the **Keledek-Katho tribe** (the "Ice-Breakers"), a clan of Goliaths dwelling in the harsh **Ironspine Mountains**. Unlike many of his kin who roamed as hunters or warriors, Kram worked the frozen earth as a **farmer**—tending hardy crops, raising livestock, and repairing structures with his hands.

But a particularly brutal winter claimed his family. With nothing left to tend, Kram took up his greataxe and left the farm to survive as an adventurer. He fought with the fury of a man who had lost everything, channeling his grief into the primal rage of a **Path of the World Tree Barbarian**.

He could hear the World Tree's voice—a vast, living presence that connected all things. It was warmth. It was life. It was purpose.

---

#### The Cold Death (End of Level 3)

Kram joined an adventuring party in Icewind Dale: **Inara** (a warlock), a paladin, a monk, and a ranger. During a contract to hunt a monstrous yeti, the creature ambushed them in a blizzard. The battle was chaos—screams swallowed by wind, blood freezing on snow.

Kram and the ranger fell.

The ranger chose not to return.

Kram's soul drifted into the silence of death—cold, empty, and absolute. And there, in that void, **Auril the Frostmaiden** found him.

She did not resurrect him out of mercy. She had *plans* for him.

---

#### The Resurrection (Level 4 Begins)

Kram woke two weeks ago on a **morgue table in Easthaven**, encased in frost. His skin had turned pale blue. His rage was gone, replaced by cold clarity. The World Tree's voice—silent.

He walked to the inn where his party had been staying. When he entered, **Auril spoke to Inara**, her warlock:
*"I have a surprise for you. You are no longer alone on your journey."*

Auril told Kram:
*"It is not yet your time. I have plans for you. You will serve me, and you will travel with Inara. You are bound together in my service."*

Kram did not refuse. He had no reason to. He was alive because she willed it.

But Auril did not explain her full purpose. She left him with questions, with silence where the World Tree once sang, and with a cold that grows more comforting each day.

The party's original paladin and monk left, disturbed by his transformation and the Frostmaiden's presence. New companions joined: **Debo** (Goblin Wizard), **Ozen** (Warforged Barbarian), and **Loam** (Tabaxi Twilight Cleric).

They do not know he died. They do not know he was once a barbarian. They know only that he is cold to the touch, quiet, and bound to Inara in ways they do not understand.

---

### Current Situation

**Location:** Easthaven, Icewind Dale
**Current Quest:** Guard duty at town hall overnight (minor local work)
**Larger Goals:**
- Find the **mansion** Kram was granted by the Throne card (Deck of Many Things). It lies somewhere between **Dougan's Hole and Good Mead near Redwaters**, occupied by something dangerous.
- Investigate rumors in Dougan's Hole and Good Mead.
- Understand what Auril wants from him.
- Protect Inara.

---

### Relationships

#### Inara (Warlock - Auril's Patron)
**Dynamic:** Closest bond. Inara knew Kram before and after his death. She is his anchor to his former self. He is deeply protective of her, checking on her regularly and positioning himself between her and danger. She sleeps in his room (not romantically), and they share the secret of his resurrection.

#### Loam (Tabaxi Twilight Cleric)
**Dynamic:** Warming to her. Loam has been kind to Kram, and he is beginning to trust her. She represents a softer presence in the party—a contrast to his coldness.

#### Debo (Goblin Wizard)
**Dynamic:** Neutral. Kram has no strong feelings toward Debo. He is functional and cooperative, but not friendly.

#### Ozen (Warforged Barbarian)
**Dynamic:** Distant. Kram respects Ozen's strength but feels little connection. Perhaps he sees echoes of his old self in Ozen's rage—something he no longer possesses.

#### Junior (Axebeak Mount)
**Dynamic:** Practical. Kram's previous axebeak died in the yeti attack. Junior is a trusted mount but not a companion. Kram cares for him efficiently but without warmth.

---

### The Frostmaiden's Mark

On the **inner forearm of Kram's left arm** is the **Frostmaiden's Brand**—a six-pointed snowflake burned into his flesh. When Kram casts spells or uses his divine powers, pale glowing threads extend from the snowflake, wrapping around his body like frost veins or chains.

This is Auril's mark. It is his holy symbol. It is proof that he belongs to her.

The new party has not yet seen it activate.

---

### The World Tree's Silence

Before death, Kram heard the **World Tree**—a vast, warm, living presence. It connected him to all life, to growth, to hope.

Now, there is only silence.

At first, the absence was stark—a gaping wound where warmth and connection once lived. But as the weeks pass, the silence grows... comfortable. The cold fills the void. The emptiness no longer aches.

Kram does not yet know if this is peace, or if he is simply becoming something else.

---

### Relationship with Auril

Kram's connection to Auril is **one-sided**. She speaks when she wishes; he listens. He has not yet prayed to her or sought communion. He is still trying to understand what she wants—what *service* truly means.

He knows she caused the **Everlasting Rime**, the endless winter and darkness choking Icewind Dale. He knows the people he helps with his party suffer because of her.

He does not yet have an opinion on this. He is still figuring things out.

But he is loyal. She gave him life. He will serve.

---

### Philosophy & Internal Conflict

Kram stands at a crossroads between two selves:

- **The Farmer:** Who loved, who lost, who built with his hands.
- **The Barbarian:** Who raged, who heard the World Tree, who fought with fire in his veins.
- **The Paladin:** Who is cold, who is disciplined, who is becoming something new.

He does not know which of these he is anymore. Perhaps he is all three. Perhaps he is none.

What he knows is this:
- The cold is comforting.
- Inara is worth protecting.
- Auril has a purpose for him, and he will discover it.

And beneath it all, buried deep in the frost:
A question he does not yet dare ask.

*Is this rebirth... or erasure?*

---

> *"Where warmth once burned, silence reigns. And in that silence, there is... clarity."*

## Notes for the Player

- **Kram is still evolving.** Don't feel pressured to have all his answers. He's figuring things out in real time.
- **Lean into the cold.** Use environmental details—mist, frost, silence—to make his presence felt.
- **Protect Inara, but don't smother her.** She's capable, and your bond is built on mutual respect.
- **Ask Auril questions.** When the moment feels right, reach out to her in prayer or meditation. Let the DM guide that conversation.
- **Use your fear abilities.** Conquering Presence is powerful (2 uses per long rest). Don't forget it in combat.
- **Track your limited resources:** Free Divine Smite (1/long rest), Frost's Chill (2/long rest), Channel Divinity (2/long rest, 1 back on short rest), Stone's Endurance (1/short rest).
- **Weapon Mastery is powerful.** Cleave lets you hit two enemies. Remember to use it when multiple foes are close together.
- **You are not a healer.** You have Lay on Hands, but your role is frontline control and damage. Use healing as a last resort.
- **Heavy Weapon Mastery is always on.** You're dealing +2 damage every single hit—it adds up fast.
