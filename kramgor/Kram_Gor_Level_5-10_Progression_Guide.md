### Level 6

**Hit Points:** ~66 HP (+7 increase: 1d10+2 CON +2 Tough, avg +7)
**Proficiency Bonus:** +3
**Spell Slots:** 4× 1st-level, 2× 2nd-level (no change)

#### Features Gained:

🛡️ **Aura of Protection (10 ft. radius)**

- **This is HUGE** - dramatically improves party survivability
- Stacks with proficiency, other bonuses
- Always active (not concentration, can't be dispelled)

- Positioning becomes important - stay near allies

#### Strategy Tips:

---

### Level 7 ⭐⭐⭐ MASSIVE POWER SPIKE

**Hit Points:** ~72 HP (+6 increase)
**Proficiency Bonus:** +3
**Spell Slots:** 4× 1st-level, 3× 2nd-level (+1 slot!)

#### Features Gained:

❄️ **Aura of Conquest (10 ft. radius)** - THE BIG ONE
- Enemies **frightened of you** within your aura:
  - Have **speed reduced to 0** (cannot move at all)
  - Take **psychic damage equal to your CHA modifier** (+2 currently) at the start of their turn
  - Still have disadvantage on attacks and can't move closer to you

#### Why This Is Game-Changing:
**Your fear build is now fully operational.**

**The Combo:**
1. Use **Conquering Presence** (Channel Divinity) to frighten all enemies in 30 ft. (WIS save DC 13)
2. Enemies who fail are now frightened
3. Any frightened enemy within 10 ft. of you:
   - **Cannot move** (speed 0)
   - Takes **2 psychic damage per turn** (3 if you increase CHA)
   - Has disadvantage on attacks and ability checks
4. Walk toward frightened enemies to lock them down
5. They're trapped, taking damage every turn, while you beat them down

**Alternative Setup:**
- Cast **Wrathful Smite**, hit enemy (frightened on 1d6 psychic damage)
- Enemy is now within your aura range
- **Speed 0, taking 2 psychic/turn**
- They need to use their action to make a WIS check (DC 13) to end frightened condition

#### Combat Impact:
- **You become a control tank** - lock down melee enemies
- Great against swarms (frighten multiple, trap them all)
- Mobile enemies become trapped
- Boss fights: frighten + trap them in your aura

#### Spell Slot Increase:
- Gain **1 more 2nd-level slot** (3 total)
- More flexibility for Hold Person, Spiritual Weapon, Aid, Prayer of Healing

#### Strategy Tips:
- **Open with Conquering Presence** vs groups
- Use Wrathful Smite vs single tough enemies
- **Position aggressively** - your aura is an offensive tool now
- Enemies will try to escape your 10 ft. zone - use opportunity attacks
- Combine with Wrathful Smite for nearly inescapable fear

### Level 8 - ASI/FEAT DECISION ⚖️

**Hit Points:** ~79 HP (+7 increase)
**Proficiency Bonus:** +3
**Spell Slots:** 4× 1st-level, 3× 2nd-level

#### Features Gained:

📈 **Ability Score Improvement OR Feat**

**This is your major build decision.** See [ASI & Feat Decisions](#asi--feat-decisions) section below for detailed analysis.

#### Quick Recommendation:
**Increase CHA 14 → 16 (+1 modifier)**

**Why:**
- Spell Save DC: 13 → **14** (enemies fail more often)
- Aura of Protection: +2 → **+3** to all saves for party
- Aura of Conquest: 2 → **3 psychic damage per turn**
- Persuasion: +9 → **+10**

**Your Conquest fear build becomes more reliable and your party becomes tougher.**

#### Alternative Options:
- **Increase STR 18 → 20:** +1 to hit, +1 damage per attack (+2 damage/turn)
- **Resilient (CON):** +1 CON, proficiency in CON saves (better concentration)
- **Sentinel:** Lock down enemies even harder (see Feat section)

---

### Level 9

**Hit Points:** ~85 HP (+6 increase)
**Proficiency Bonus:** +4 ⭐
**Spell Slots:** 4× 1st-level, 3× 2nd-level, 2× 3rd-level

#### Features Gained:

✨ **3rd-Level Spells & Oath Spells**
- **Fear** (Oath) - Frighten multiple enemies in 30 ft. cone
- **Bestow Curse** (Oath) - Debuff single enemy with various curses

💪 **Proficiency Bonus Increases to +4**

#### Why This Matters:

**Proficiency +4 increases:**
- **Spell Save DC:** 13 → **14** (or 14 → **15** if you took +CHA at level 8)
- **Spell Attack Bonus:** +5 → **+6** (or +6 → **+7** with +CHA)
- **Attack Bonus:** +8 → **+9** with Berserker Axe

- **Persuasion:** +9 → **+10** (or +10 → **+11** with +CHA)

- **Bestow Curse (Oath):** Versatile debuff, lasts 1 minute (conc.)
- **Spirit Shroud:** +1d8 damage on ALL your attacks, slow enemies (bonus action, 1 min, conc.)
- **Aura of Vitality:** Heal 2d6 HP as bonus action for 1 minute (very efficient healing)
- **Blinding Smite:** +3d8 radiant, blind target
- **Crusader's Mantle:** All allies within 30 ft. deal +1d4 radiant on attacks
- **Daylight:** 60 ft. sphere bright light, dispels magical darkness
- **Remove Curse:** Remove curse effects

#### Combat Impact:

**Your Fear Build Peaks Here:**
1. **Cast Fear** (Oath spell, 3rd-level) in a 30 ft. cone
2. Multiple enemies frightened, flee away from you
3. Move toward them - they enter your **Aura of Conquest**
4. **Speed 0, taking 2-3 psychic damage per turn**
5. They're trapped and dying

**OR:**

1. Cast **Spirit Shroud** (bonus action, 3rd-level)
2. Attack twice: 1d12+7 + 1d8 + 1d8 (two attacks)
3. **~45 damage per turn** before smites
4. Enemies within 10 ft. have speed reduced by 10

**Healing Efficiency:**
- **Aura of Vitality:** 2d6 HP as bonus action × 10 turns = up to 20d6 (70 HP) healing from one 3rd-level slot
- **Prayer of Healing:** 2d8+3 HP × 6 creatures = ~13 HP each
- Aura of Vitality is more efficient for sustained healing

#### Strategy Tips:
- **Fear** is your crowd-control nuke against groups
- **Spirit Shroud** is your sustained damage buff (better than Divine Favor)
- **Aura of Vitality** is insanely efficient out-of-combat healing
- Save 3rd-level slots for key moments
- Your DC is now high enough (14-15) to land fear effects consistently

---

### Level 10

**Hit Points:** ~92 HP (+7 increase)
**Proficiency Bonus:** +4
**Spell Slots:** 4× 1st-level, 3× 2nd-level, 2× 3rd-level

#### Features Gained:

😤 **Aura of Courage (10 ft. radius)**
- You and allies within 10 ft. **cannot be frightened**
- Always active, even if you're incapacitated
- Suppresses existing frightened conditions while in aura

#### Why This Matters:
- **Dragons can't frighten your party**
- **Undead fear effects (e.g., banshee wail) don't work**
- **Enemy fear-based builds are completely negated**
- Thematically perfect: You've mastered cold fear; mundane fear means nothing

#### Irony:
You frighten enemies, but you yourself are beyond fear. Cold, unyielding, inevitable.

#### Combat Impact:
- **Defensive party buff** vs specific enemies (dragons, certain undead, aberrations)
- Situational, but powerful when it matters
- No offensive change from level 9

#### Strategy Tips:
- Less impactful than previous levels, but crucial against fear-based enemies
- Focus on perfecting your level 9 tactics (Fear + Aura of Conquest, Spirit Shroud)
- Save resources for level 11 (Improved Divine Smite - always-on +1d8 radiant)

## ASI & Feat Decisions

### Level 8: Your Big Choice

You have three main paths:

---

### Path A: Increase Charisma (14 → 16) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Stat Changes:**
- CHA: 14 → 16 (+2 modifier → +3 modifier)

**Benefits:**
| What Improves | Before | After | Impact |
|:--------------|:------:|:-----:|:-------|
| Spell Save DC | 13 | **14** | Enemies fail 5% more often |
| Spell Attack | +5 | **+6** | +5% hit chance |
| Aura of Protection | +2 | **+3** | Party saves +1 better |
| Aura of Conquest | 2 psychic/turn | **3 psychic/turn** | +50% damage |
| Persuasion | +9 | **+10** | Better social encounters |
| Lay on Hands | 40 HP pool | 40 HP pool | No change |

**Pros:**
✅ **Your entire Conquest fear build becomes more reliable**
✅ Fear effects land more often (better DC)
✅ Party saves improve significantly (+3 is huge)
✅ Aura of Conquest deals 50% more psychic damage
✅ Synergizes with ALL your Conquest abilities
✅ Scales into late game (aura range increases at 18)
✅ Better spellcasting for utility/support spells

**Cons:**
❌ Only -1 to hit and damage compared to maxing STR (minor)
❌ Doesn't improve your raw attack power

**Verdict:**
**Best choice for Kram's Conquest build.** You're not a pure damage dealer - you're a control tank who frightens and locks down enemies. Increasing CHA makes your core identity better.

---

### Path B: Increase Strength (18 → 20)

**Stat Changes:**
- STR: 18 → 20 (+4 modifier → +5 modifier)

**Benefits:**
| What Improves | Before | After | Impact |
|:--------------|:------:|:-----:|:-------|
| Attack Bonus | +8 | **+9** | +5% hit chance |
| Damage per Hit | 1d12+7 | **1d12+8** | +1 damage/hit |
| Damage per Turn | ~28 | ~30 | +2 average damage/turn |
| Athletics | +7 | **+8** | Better grappling/shoving |

**Pros:**
✅ Higher attack bonus (hit more consistently)
✅ More damage per turn (+2 avg, +4 on crits)
✅ Better grappling/shoving (situational)
✅ Maxed primary attack stat (no need to invest later)

**Cons:**
❌ Doesn't improve your fear build at all
❌ Aura of Protection stays at +2 (party is less protected)
❌ Spell Save DC stays at 13 (enemies save more often)
❌ Aura of Conquest stays at 2 psychic/turn
❌ Less effective against bosses with high AC (your smites are more valuable than +1 to hit)

**Verdict:**
Good for pure damage optimization, but **doesn't synergize with Conquest build**. You're already dealing good damage; your strength is control, not raw DPR.

---

### Path C: Resilient (Constitution)

**Effect:**
- +1 CON (14 → 15, +2 modifier → +2 modifier - no change)
- **Gain proficiency in CON saving throws**

**Benefits:**
| What Improves | Before | After | Impact |
|:--------------|:------:|:-----:|:-------|
| CON Saves | +2 | **+5** | +3 to concentration saves |
| Hit Points | +1 retroactive | +1 per level | +9 HP immediately |

**Concentration Save Examples:**
- Take 10 damage → DC 10 CON save → +2 (45% pass) vs **+5 (70% pass)**
- Take 22 damage → DC 11 CON save → +2 (40% pass) vs **+5 (65% pass)**

**Pros:**
✅ **Much harder to break concentration** (Wrathful Smite, Bless, Spirit Shroud)
✅ +9 HP immediately (retroactive Tough bonus)
✅ Better against poison/exhaustion/death saves
✅ Rounds out your defenses

**Cons:**
❌ Doesn't improve offense at all
❌ Doesn't improve Conquest abilities
❌ Many paladin spells don't require concentration (armor, smites)
❌ You have Chain Mail (AC 17) - you don't get hit *that* often

**Verdict:**
Solid defensive choice, especially if you use concentration spells often (Bless, Spirit Shroud, Wrathful Smite). **Good, but not optimal for Kram's build.**

---

### Path D: Sentinel (Feat)

**Effect:**
- When you hit with opportunity attack, target's speed becomes 0
- When enemy attacks ally within 5 ft., you can reaction attack them
- Creatures can't use Disengage to avoid your opportunity attacks

**Synergy with Aura of Conquest:**
1. Enemy is frightened, trapped in your aura (speed 0)
2. Fear ends on their turn (they succeed save)
3. They try to move away
4. **Opportunity attack** → Hit → **Speed 0 again** (Sentinel)
5. They're stuck for another turn

OR:

1. Enemy attacks Inara (standing next to you)
2. **Reaction attack** (Sentinel)
3. If they're frightened, combine with your aura for lockdown

**Pros:**
✅ **Insane synergy with Aura of Conquest** (double lockdown)
✅ Protect allies proactively (reaction attacks)
✅ Control battlefield positioning
✅ Enemies can't escape easily
✅ Disrupt enemy hit-and-run tactics

**Cons:**
❌ No stat increases
❌ Doesn't improve your auras, DC, or damage
❌ Requires enemies to be in melee range
❌ Uses your reaction (can't use Stone's Endurance same turn)

**Verdict:**
**Excellent thematic fit for Conquest.** Creates a "no escape" zone around you. Great if you want to be the ultimate tank/controller. **Second-best choice after +CHA.**

---

### Path E: War Caster (Feat)

**Effect:**
- Advantage on concentration saves
- Can perform somatic components with weapon/shield
- Can cast spells as opportunity attacks

**Pros:**
✅ Better concentration (similar to Resilient CON, but advantage instead)
✅ Can use shield + weapon while casting (currently you have free hand)
✅ Cast Wrathful Smite as opportunity attack (frighten fleeing enemies)

**Cons:**
❌ No stat increases
❌ You already have free hands (two-handed weapon only restricts during attacks)
❌ Advantage on CON saves is good, but not as reliable as proficiency long-term
❌ Spell opportunity attacks are niche

**Verdict:**
Decent, but **Resilient (CON) is better long-term** for concentration. War Caster is better for casters who need weapons + shields. You don't.

---

### My Recommendation: Priority Order

**1st Choice: +2 CHA (14 → 16)** ⭐⭐⭐
- Best for Conquest build, improves everything you do

**2nd Choice: Sentinel** ⭐⭐
- Amazing synergy, perfect thematic fit, ultimate lockdown

**3rd Choice: Resilient (CON)** ⭐
- Solid defense, better concentration

**4th Choice: +2 STR (18 → 20)**
- Pure damage, but doesn't fit your build identity

**5th Choice: War Caster**
- Decent, but Resilient is better

---

## Build Path Analysis

Let's compare three full progression paths from level 5 to 20:

---

### Build Path 1: "The Frostmaiden's Warden" (Control Focus) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Philosophy:** Maximize fear, control, and party support. Become the ultimate Conquest paladin.

| Level | Choice | STR | CHA | Spell DC | Aura of Protection | Notes |
|:-----:|:-------|:---:|:---:|:--------:|:------------------:|:------|
| 5-7 | - | 18 | 14 | 13 | +2 | Build foundation |
| 8 | **+2 CHA** | 18 | **16** | **14** | **+3** | Fear build optimized |
| 12 | **+2 STR** | **20** | 16 | 15 | +3 | Max melee power |
| 16 | **+2 CHA** | 20 | **18** | **17** | **+4** | Elite control |
| 19 | **+2 STR** or Feat | 20+ | 18+ | 17+ | +4 | Capstone choice |

**Final Stats (Level 16):**
- STR 20, CHA 18
- Spell Save DC: **17** (very hard to resist)
- Aura of Protection: **+4** to all saves
- Aura of Conquest: **4 psychic damage per turn**
- Attack: +11 to hit, 1d12+8 damage (×2)

**Pros:**
✅ Best Conquest paladin performance
✅ Party support is incredible (+4 to all saves)
✅ Fear effects almost always land
✅ Balanced offense and control

**Cons:**
❌ Slightly delayed STR maxing (level 12 vs 8)
❌ -1 to hit/damage until level 12

**Best For:** Kram's character identity (cold, controlling, inevitable)

---

### Build Path 2: "The Frozen Berserker" (Damage Focus)

**Philosophy:** Max damage first, control second. Hit hard, frighten later.

| Level | Choice | STR | CHA | Spell DC | Aura of Protection | Notes |
|:-----:|:-------|:---:|:---:|:--------:|:------------------:|:------|
| 5-7 | - | 18 | 14 | 13 | +2 | Build foundation |
| 8 | **+2 STR** | **20** | 14 | 13 | +2 | Max damage early |
| 12 | **+2 CHA** | 20 | **16** | **15** | **+3** | Catch up control |
| 16 | **+2 CHA** | 20 | **18** | **17** | **+4** | Elite control |
| 19 | **Sentinel** or +CON | 20 | 18 | 17 | +4 | Utility choice |

**Final Stats (Level 16):** Same as Path 1

**Pros:**
✅ Higher damage from levels 8-12
✅ Better at pure combat early

**Cons:**
❌ Worse spell DC from levels 8-12 (enemies save more)
❌ Worse party support from levels 8-12 (+2 saves vs +3)
❌ Aura of Conquest weaker early (2 vs 3 psychic damage)

**Best For:** Players who prioritize raw damage over control

---

### Build Path 3: "The Untouchable Warden" (Defense/Control Focus)

**Philosophy:** Be unkillable, control everything, support party.

| Level | Choice | STR | CHA | CON | Spell DC | Notes |
|:-----:|:-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:--------:|:------|
| 5-7 | - | 18 | 14 | 14 | 13 | Build foundation |
| 8 | **+2 CHA** | 18 | **16** | 14 | **14** | Control focus |
| 12 | **Resilient CON** | 18 | 16 | **15** | 15 | Concentration master |
| 16 | **+2 STR** | **20** | 16 | 15 | 16 | Finally max STR |
| 19 | **Sentinel** | 20 | 16 | 15 | 16 | Ultimate lockdown |

**Final Stats (Level 16):**
- STR 20, CHA 16, CON 15 (proficient saves)
- Spell Save DC: 16 (good, not elite)
- CON saves: +8 (incredible concentration)
- Aura of Protection: +3

**Pros:**
✅ Nearly unbreakable concentration
✅ Elite survivability
✅ Good control (DC 16)
✅ Sentinel lockdown at 19

**Cons:**
❌ Delayed STR maxing (level 16!)
❌ Lower damage until late game
❌ Lower spell DC than Path 1

**Best For:** Tanks who want to be unkillable and support-focused

---

### My Recommendation

**Build Path 1: "The Frostmaiden's Warden"**

**Progression:**
- Level 8: **+2 CHA** (14 → 16)
- Level 12: **+2 STR** (18 → 20)
- Level 16: **+2 CHA** (16 → 18)
- Level 19: **Sentinel** or **+2 STR** (20 → 22)

This path embraces Kram's identity as Auril's instrument of conquest - cold, controlling, inevitable. You become a nightmare for enemies (DC 17 fear effects!) while keeping your party alive (+4 to all saves).

---

### When to Short Rest

**You benefit greatly from short rests:**

**Short rest after:**

- Before a known tough fight

**Don't short rest when:**
- You still have both Channel Divinity
- Party is healthy and you have spell slots
- Time pressure in story

---

### When to Long Rest

**Long rest when:**
- Out of 3rd-level spell slots (level 9-10)
- Used free Divine Smite + most spell slots

### Kram's Identity: The Instrument of Winter

**At level 5-7:** You're a powerful warrior, but still finding your way.

**At level 7:** Auril's purpose becomes clear. You're not just a fighter - you're winter's judgment. Enemies who see you *know* fear, and that fear traps them in your cold aura. You are inevitable.

**At level 9-10:** You've mastered your role. Fear spreads before you (Fear spell), your strikes are enhanced by the grave (Spirit Shroud), and your cold presence locks down the battlefield (Aura of Conquest). You are the Frostmaiden's Warden.
