## Repository Type: D&D Character Documentation

**IMPORTANT:** This is NOT a software development project. This is a tabletop RPG character development and documentation system for D&D 5e (2024 rules).

**No build/test/lint commands** - This repository contains Markdown documentation only.

**Key Files:**
- `Kram_Gor_Conquest_Paladin.md` - Complete character sheet (8 sections: stats, spells, features, combat, roleplay)
- `Kram_Gor_Level_5-10_Progression_Guide.md` - Leveling recommendations and build paths
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file (project context and guidelines)

**When working in this repository:**
- Maintain 2024 D&D rules accuracy (NOT 2014 rules)
- Preserve thematic consistency (frost/cold/silence/Auril)
- Keep character voice guidelines (economical speech, cold demeanor)
- Update version numbers and "Last Updated" timestamps when editing character documents

# Kram Gor Character Development Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive character development and documentation system for **Kram Gor**, a level 4 Goliath Oath of Conquest Paladin in a D&D 5e (2024 rules) Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden campaign.

The character has a unique and tragic backstory: formerly a farmer-turned-barbarian (Path of the World Tree), Kram died at level 3 during a yeti attack and was resurrected by **Auril, the Frostmaiden**. His class changed from Barbarian to Paladin, representing his transformation from fiery rage to cold, calculated discipline. He is slowly becoming Auril's instrument of conquest while grappling with the loss of the World Tree's warm voice, now replaced by frigid silence.

## Campaign Context

- **Setting:** Icewind Dale (Everlasting Rime - endless winter caused by Auril)
- **Current Location:** Easthaven
- **Party Composition:**
  - **Inara** (Warlock, Auril patron) - Kram's closest ally, knew him before death
  - **Loam** (Tabaxi Twilight Cleric) - Kind, Kram is warming to her
  - **Debo** (Goblin Wizard) - Neutral relationship
  - **Ozen** (Warforged Barbarian) - Distant relationship

- **Key Plot Points:**
  - Only Inara knows Kram died and was resurrected
  - New party members think he's always been a paladin
  - Kram has a mansion deed (Deck of Many Things - Throne card) between Dougan's Hole and Good Mead
  - Seeking to understand what Auril wants from him

## Character Identity & Themes

**Core Conflict:** Transformation from warm (farmer/barbarian connected to World Tree) to cold (paladin serving goddess of winter)

**Key Features:**
- Physically cold to the touch, mist follows him
- Bald Goliath, pale light blue skin (was navy blue before death)
- Frostmaiden's Brand on inner left forearm (glows when casting)
- Seeks cold places, protective of Inara
- Quiet, economical with words, imposing presence
- Uses frost/ice flavor for all divine abilities

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Character Interview & Information Gathering
Conducted a comprehensive 59-question interview to establish:
- Complete mechanical build (stats, feats, equipment)
- Detailed backstory (farmer → barbarian → death → paladin)
- Current party dynamics and relationships
- Personality traits, quirks, and mannerisms
- Campaign context and current goals
- Thematic elements and flavor descriptions

### 2. Character Document Creation

### 3. 2024 Rules Integration
Updated the entire document to match 2024 D&D rules based on D&D Beyond character sheet:

- **Speed:** 35 ft (not 30)
- **Weapon Mastery:** Greataxe (Cleave), Greatsword (Graze)
- **Paladin's Smite:** 1 free use per long rest
- **Channel Divinity:** 2 uses per long rest, regain 1 on short rest
- **Divine Sense:** Now a Channel Divinity option (Bonus Action)
- **Frost's Chill:** 2/long rest, +1d6 cold + reduce speed
- **Great Weapon Master (2024):** Heavy Weapon Mastery (+2 damage always), Hew (bonus attack on crit/kill)
- **Tough Feat:** +8 HP at level 4, +2 per level
- **Persuasion:** Corrected to +8 (Throne card: +1 then doubled)

### 4. Combat Optimization
Calculated all attack combinations:
- Standard attack: 1d12+7 (avg 14)
- With Frost's Chill: +1d6 cold, reduce speed (avg 17)
- With Divine Smite: +2d8 radiant (avg 23)
- Combined attacks for maximum damage scenarios
- Cleave mechanics for multi-target damage

### 5. Thematic Integration
Developed consistent frost/winter flavor for all abilities:
- Divine Smite: "thunderous crack, like a glacier splitting"
- Conquering Presence: "unnatural silence and stillness"
- Frost's Chill: "bite of the Ironspine's eternal winter"
- All spells given Auril-themed descriptions

## Current Status

### Document Version
- **Version:** 2.1 (2024 D&D Rules + Level 5-10 Progression Guide)
- **Character Level:** 5 (as of progression guide)
- **Location in Campaign:** Easthaven area
- **Document Status:** ✅ Character sheet complete, ✅ Progression guide complete (levels 5-10)

### Known Issues to Address
1. **Prepared Spells:** Currently have 5 spells prepared, but should only have 4. Need to choose which one to drop or clarify house rule.

  - Pros/cons and level timing

- **Magic Item Wishlist**
  - Frost-themed items that fit character

## How to Use This Project

### For the Player
1. Use Section 1-4 of the character document for at-the-table reference
2. Review Section 5-8 for roleplay inspiration and character voice
3. Consult combat cheat sheets during battles
4. Use spell flavor descriptions to enhance narrative
5. Reference the progression guide when leveling up or planning character development
6. Use situational spell loadouts from the progression guide to prepare spells each day

### For Claude (AI Assistant)
1. Read this CLAUDE.md first to understand project context
2. Reference `Kram_Gor_Conquest_Paladin.md` for complete character details
3. Maintain consistency with established themes (frost/cold/silence/conquest)
4. Keep 2024 D&D rules in mind for all mechanics
5. Remember character's emotional journey: warmth → silence → cold comfort
6. Respect established relationships (especially Inara as anchor, Loam as emerging connection)

### For the DM
- Character has built-in plot hooks with Auril's mysterious plans
- Mansion quest provides adventure goal
- Internal conflict (erasure vs. rebirth) offers character arc opportunities
- Party tension possible if Auril's role becomes known to others

## Character Voice Guidelines

When writing or speaking as Kram:
- Short, deliberate sentences
- Economical with words, not rude
- Occasional philosophical observations about cold/endurance/strength
- Protective of Inara (actions more than words)
- Uncomfortable with warmth (literal and metaphorical)
- Slowly growing more comfortable with the void where the World Tree was
- Does not yet fully understand Auril's plans
- Quiet authority, not boastful

**Good examples:**
- "The cold does not lie."
- "She's safer if I'm between her and them."
- "I don't remember the warmth. Not anymore."

**Avoid:**
- Long speeches
- Emotional outbursts
- Explaining his feelings unprompted
- References to "the old me" (he doesn't think that way)

## Design Philosophy

This project aims to create a **fully playable, mechanically optimized, thematically rich** character that:

1. **Works at the table** - Quick reference, clear mechanics, easy to play
2. **Tells a story** - Every mechanical choice reinforces the narrative
3. **Grows with the campaign** - Built-in character arcs and development hooks
4. **Respects the player** - Organized for both new and experienced players
5. **Honors the setting** - Deeply integrated with Icewind Dale themes

## Notes

- Character is intentionally morally complex (serves the campaign's villain goddess)
- Build has clear power spikes at levels 5 and 7
- Frost theme is consistent but not overdone
- Player is relatively new to D&D - documentation should be clear and accessible
- 2024 rules significantly change some mechanics (no -5/+10 GWM, different Channel Divinity, etc.)
