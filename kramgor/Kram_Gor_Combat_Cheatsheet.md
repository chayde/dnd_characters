## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### ✅ ALWAYS REMEMBER
- **You attack TWICE per turn** (Extra Attack at level 5)
- **Divine Smite is NOT a spell** - you can smite + cast bonus action spell same turn
- **You get 1 FREE Divine Smite per long rest** - use it early!
- **Heavy Weapon Mastery is always on** - you deal +2 damage on every hit (already in your damage)
- **Cleave works once per turn** - if you hit, attack a second creature within 5 ft. of first

### ⚠️ DON'T FORGET
- **Concentration:** Only one concentration spell at a time (Bless, Wrathful Smite, Divine Favor, etc.)
- **Aura of Protection:** Allies within 10 ft. get +2 to ALL saves
- **Frost's Chill is limited:** Only 2 uses per long rest - save for important moments
- **Channel Divinity recharges on short rest:** You get 1 use back
- **Conquering Presence needs line of sight:** Won't work on enemies who can't see/hear you

### 🎯 TACTICAL TIPS
- **Hold your free Divine Smite for a crit** - double the dice!
- **Use Guided Strike (+10 to hit) to guarantee big smites land**
- **Wrathful Smite is better single-target, Divine Favor better for long fights**
- **Spiritual Weapon is amazing action economy** - no concentration!
- **Hold Person on humanoids = auto-crit = double smite dice**
- **Stay near Inara and Loam** - your Aura of Protection helps them survive
