## Usage Guidelines for Gemini

### 1. Rule System: D&D 5e (2024)
*   ALWAYS reference the **2024 Player's Handbook** rules.
*   Key changes from 2014 to note:
    *   **Divine Smite:** Now a Bonus Action (spell), once per turn.
    *   **Great Weapon Master:** Proficiency bonus to damage (no -5/+10).
    *   **Weapon Masteries:** Cleave (Greataxe), Graze (Greatsword).
    *   **Channel Divinity:** 2 uses per Short Rest.

### 2. Thematic Consistency
*   **Flavor Text:** When describing abilities, use imagery of frost, ice, silence, shattering glaciers, and numbing cold.
*   **Character Voice:** Kram speaks rarely. Sentences are short, direct, and pragmatic. He is not cruel, but he is unyielding like winter.
    *   *Good:* "Silence falls." / "You break." / "Winter takes you."
    *   *Bad:* Long monologues, fiery passion, hesitation.

### 3. Maintenance
*   When the user requests updates (e.g., leveling up, new items), update **both** the main character sheet (`Kram_Gor_Conquest_Paladin.md`) and the progression guide if necessary.
*   Ensure math (Save DCs, Attack Bonuses, Skill totals) is recalculated accurately based on current stats and proficiency bonuses.

### 4. Party Context
*   **Inara (Warlock):** Kram's anchor to humanity. He is protective of her.
*   **Loam (Cleric):** A new source of warmth he is learning to accept.
*   **Auril:** His patron. He fears and respects her, acting as her instrument while grappling with his lost past.
