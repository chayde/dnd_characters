## ⚔️ Background — *The Vanished*
> “I used to be a member of an organization in my younger years called the Vanished.  
> I was just a small-time muscle guy. Someone brought along to rough up debtors or look intimidating.”

**Faction Summary:**
- **The Vanished** operate in the shadows of Gray Haven, dabbling in every vice: illegal gambling, smuggling, brothels, protection rackets, and fencing stolen goods.  
- Their mark is a **stylized closed eye**, seen in every establishment they control.  
- Known associates include:
  - **Tinker** — a cunning fence and informant who still trades with Bwayne despite his departure.
- While Bwayne left their service, his knowledge of **passphrases, symbols, and safehouses** still grants him limited access.

**Reputation:**  
Former enforcer turned holy avenger. The Vanished view him as a “deserter,” tolerated only so long as he brings value or tribute.

His oath is not about redemption but reckoning; his sword an extension of divine judgment.  
Every swing is a sermon. Every smite, a verse in Hoar’s poetry of justice.
