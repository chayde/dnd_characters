Hoar (pronounced: /ˈhɔːr/ HOR[8]) was the Faerûnian god of retribution, revenge, and poetic justice.[8] The Doombringer spent some time as an exarch of Bane[4] and was invoked by those who would have an eye for an eye.[8]

“
Violence repays violence. Evil repays evil. Good repays good. These are the tenets of Hoar, who brings justice and retribution to each according to their actions. Allowances? Excuses set forth to falsely acquit the condemned. Allowances exploit, pervert, and impede the course of justice. If you cannot see this, we've nothing to discuss.
