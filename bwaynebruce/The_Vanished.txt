
I used to be a member of an organization in my younger years called the Vanished.

I was just a small time muscle guy. Someone brought along to rough up debtors or look intimidating. 

((General info you'd know is that the Vanished have a finger in anything profitable. Illegal gambling halls, bars, brothels, you name it they have a rep that can peddle it or find it for you.))

The Vanished use a symbol in all their spots, a stylized closed eye. Functionally I know Pass phrases and symbols they use, businesses they like to run etc. My info is a little outdated, but they'd get you in with some of the more established places

There's a fence you can go to if you need to get rid of something and make a bit of cash, he goes by Tinker. There's a gambling hall in Gray Haven that I still have access to that doubles as a place to pick up marks and jobs for the Vanished, they'd probably only trust you with small time stuff unless you brought something to smooth things over with. They don't take super kindly to "deserters"

Tinker took a shine to me during my time with the Vanished and I've kept in loose contact with him in the years after I left to become a Paladin. He gives no shits who my loyalties lie with, he's just there to make money and hawk goods to those who will listen to his BS.
