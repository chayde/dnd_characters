## Spell Strategy Notes

### Combat Opening (from combatblock.md)
1. **If Mage Armor not active:** Cast it (should be active already from morning)
2. **If facing multiple enemies:** Mirror Image for defense
3. **If enemies clustered:** Sleep (if low HP) or wait for Fireball at level 5
4. **If single strong enemy:** Position safely, prepare to use Shield reaction

### Damage Priority
- **Injured enemies:** Toll the Dead (1d12 if wounded, 1d8 if healthy)
- **Healthy single target:** Darkbolt (3d10 cold + reaction denial)
- **Guaranteed damage:** Magic Missile (3d4+3, auto-hit)
- **Multiple weak enemies:** Sleep (ends encounters at low levels)
- **Debuff setup:** Mind Sliver (1d6 psychic + target gets -1d4 on next save)
- **Later levels:** Fireball for groups, Vampiric Touch for sustain

### Defensive Layers
1. **Prevention:** Stay 60+ ft from enemies, use Ink to scout
2. **AC:** Mage Armor (AC 15) + Shield reaction (AC 20)
3. **Misdirection:** Mirror Image (attacks hit duplicates)
4. **Escape:** Misty Step (30 ft teleport as bonus action)

### Grim Harvest Optimization
- Grim Harvest triggers when you kill with a spell of 1st level or higher
- **Necromancy spells** heal for 3× spell level
- **Other spells** heal for 2× spell level
- **Cantrips don't trigger Grim Harvest** (must be 1st level or higher)

**Current necromancy spells that trigger Grim Harvest:**
- None at level 4 (no necromancy spells in current list)
- **Later additions:** Vampiric Touch (3rd), Blight (4th), etc.
