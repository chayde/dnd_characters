# Character Build Plan - Silas Graves

## Build Concept

**Core Idea:** Benevolent necromancer who views death as a natural transition, not a tool for evil. Professional undertaker who uses magic to preserve dignity in death.

**Combat Role:** Controller/Damage Dealer with defensive layering
**Primary Strategy:** Control battlefield with spells like Sleep, eliminate injured enemies with Toll the Dead, and survive using Shield/Mirror Image/Misty Step. Use Grim Harvest to sustain in prolonged fights.

## Chosen Build Path

### Class: Wizard (School of Necromancy) ✓
**Why Wizard?**
- Largest spell list provides versatility for different situations
- Ritual casting for utility spells (Detect Magic, Identify, Gentle Repose)
- Arcane Recovery allows spell slot recovery on short rest
- Intelligence-based spellcasting fits the scholarly undertaker concept

**Why Necromancy?**
- Thematic synergy with undertaker background
- Grim Harvest provides sustain in combat (heal when killing with spells)
- Necromancy Savant makes collecting death-themed spells easier
- Subverts "evil necromancer" trope with Neutral Good alignment

### Race: Rock Gnome ✓
**Why Rock Gnome?**
- **+2 INT from racial bonus:** Enables starting with 17 INT (boosted to 19 at level 4)
- **Gnome Cunning:** Advantage on INT/WIS/CHA saves against magic is EXTREMELY valuable for maintaining concentration and resisting enemy spells
- **Small size:** Fits the unassuming undertaker theme, can move through larger creatures' spaces
- **Darkvision:** Essential for dungeon delving and working in crypts
- **Artificer's Lore:** Bonus to History checks on magical items fits scholarly character
- **Tinker:** Can create small clockwork devices (thematic for creating memorial items)

## Level 1-4 Progression (Completed)

### Level 1 ✓
- **Class:** Wizard
- **Cantrips:** Chill Touch, Toll the Dead, Mage Hand, Minor Illusion
- **Starting Spells:** Focus on versatility and survival
- **Key Decision:** Took necromancy-themed cantrips (Chill Touch, Toll the Dead) for thematic consistency

### Level 2 ✓
- **Gained:** Necromancy Savant feature
- **Spell Slots:** 3x 1st level
- **Focus:** Added ritual spells to spellbook (Detect Magic, Identify, Comprehend Languages, Unseen Servant)

### Level 3 ✓
- **Gained:** Grim Harvest (healing when killing with spells)
- **2nd-Level Spells:** Mirror Image, Misty Step, Gentle Repose
- **Key Decisions:**
  - Mirror Image for defense
  - Misty Step for mobility
  - Gentle Repose for thematic preservation of the dead

### Level 4 ✓
- **ASI Choice:** +2 Intelligence (17 → 19)
- **Rationale:** Boosting primary stat increases spell attack (+7), spell save DC (15), and prepared spells (7 currently, can prepare 8)
- **Alternative Considered:** War Caster feat, but decided raw INT boost more valuable at this level

## Ability Score Build ✓

**Starting Scores (with Point Buy):**
- STR 8 (dump stat)
- DEX 14 (AC and initiative)
- CON 14 (HP and concentration saves)
- INT 15 (+2 racial = 17, then +2 ASI at level 4 = 19)
- WIS 12 (decent perception and saves)
- CHA 10 (not needed for build)

**Priorities:**
1. **INT to 19** - Maximizes spell effectiveness
2. **CON 14** - Essential with d6 hit die, helps concentration
3. **DEX 14** - Boosts AC to 15 with Mage Armor, decent initiative
4. **WIS 12** - Acceptable for saving throws
5. **CHA/STR** - Dumps, not relevant to build

## Future Levels (5-8 Planning)

### Level 5 ✓ (COMPLETED)
- **3rd-Level Spells unlocked** - Major power spike
- **Spell Slots:** 4/3/2
- **Cantrip Scaling:** Toll the Dead (2d8/2d12), Chill Touch (2d8), Mind Sliver (2d6)
- **Spells Taken:**
  - **Animate Dead ✓** - Core necromancy spell, fits Silas's philosophy of extending time and life
  - **Counterspell ✓** - Essential defensive tool against enemy spellcasters
- **Next Priority Spells:**
  - **Vampiric Touch:** Necromancy healing spell, triggers Grim Harvest for 9 HP
  - **Speak with Dead:** Perfect for undertaker investigating Curse of Strahd mysteries
  - **Fireball:** Standard AoE damage to fill gap in spell list
  - **Hypnotic Pattern:** Top-tier crowd control

### Level 6 ✓ (COMPLETED)
- **Undead Thralls Feature:** MAJOR POWER SPIKE for necromancer build
  - Undead created with Animate Dead gain maximum HP equal to your wizard level (+6 HP at level 6)
  - Add your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls (+3 at level 6)

**Buffed Undead Stats at Level 6:**
- **Rose (Skeleton):** AC 13, HP 19 (was 13), Shortsword +4 (1d6+5), Shortbow +4 (1d6+5)
- **Thorn (Skeleton):** AC 13, HP 19 (was 13), Shortsword +4 (1d6+5), Shortbow +4 (1d6+5)
- **Mook (Zombie):** AC 8, HP 28 (was 22), Slam +3 (1d6+4)

**Other Level 6 Changes:**
- HP: 33 → **44** (Updated via D&D Beyond)
- Spell Slots: 4/3/2 → **4/3/3** (gain one more 3rd-level slot!)
- Prepared Spells: 9 → **10** (INT 4 + Level 6)
- Learn **2 new spells** for free when leveling up

**Spells Learned at Level 6:**
1. **Fireball ✓** (3rd, Evocation) - 8d6 fire AOE damage, learned after facing 24 vampire spawn
2. **Vampiric Touch ✓** (3rd, Necromancy) - 3d6 necrotic + heal half + Grim Harvest synergy
3. **Hypnotic Pattern ✓** (3rd, Illusion) - Top-tier crowd control, copied from scroll/spellbook

**Why This Level Was Huge:**
- ✓ Extra 3rd-level slot means can maintain undead AND cast Fireball/Counterspell/combat spells
- ✓ Undead got significantly tougher (+6 HP each) and hit harder (+3 damage)
- ✓ 10 prepared spells gives more flexibility
- ✓ Rose & Thorn became legitimate combatants (1d6+5 damage per hit, 19 HP each)
- ✓ Mook became a serious tank (28 HP with Undead Fortitude, 1d6+4 damage)
- ✓ Gained AOE damage (Fireball), crowd control (Hypnotic Pattern), and self-healing (Vampiric Touch)

### Level 7
- **4th-Level Spells unlocked**
- **Consider:** Polymorph, Banishment, Greater Invisibility

### Level 8
- **Second ASI:**
  - **Option 1:** INT 19 → 20 (max out primary stat)
  - **Option 2:** War Caster feat (advantage on concentration, cast with hands full)
  - **Option 3:** Resilient (CON) if not already proficient
  - **Recommendation:** INT to 20 for +5 modifier, then take feats at 12

## Feat Considerations (Future ASIs)

**War Caster** (Priority for level 12)
- Advantage on concentration saves
- Cast spells with hands full (holding bone amulet focus)
- Opportunity attack with spells

**Resilient (CON)** (If concentration is still an issue)
- Proficiency in CON saves for concentration
- Stacks with existing +2 CON modifier

**Lucky**
- Three rerolls per long rest
- Can save crucial concentration checks or important spell attacks

## Current Spell Strategy

### Combat Tactics (Updated)

**Round 1:**
- Cast Mage Armor if not already active (should be cast after long rest), OR
- Cast Mirror Image for defense against multiple attackers

**Round 2+:**
- **Injured enemies:** Toll the Dead (1d12 if wounded, 1d8 if healthy)
- **Single target damage:** Darkbolt (3×1d10 cold + reaction denial on failed CON save)
- **Guaranteed damage:** Magic Missile (3d4+3, never misses)
- **Setup for allies:** Mind Sliver (1d6 psychic, target gets -1d4 on next save)
- **Groups of weak enemies:** Sleep (extremely effective at early levels)

**Bonus Actions:**
- Misty Step to reposition (30 ft teleport)
- Command Ink to scout or deliver touch spells (if you prepare any)

**Reactions:**
- Shield to block critical hits (boosts AC from 15 to 20)

### Spell Synergies
- **Mind Sliver + Party Spells:** Use Mind Sliver to give target -1d4 on saves, then party members hit them with save-or-suck spells
- **Gnome Cunning + Concentration:** Advantage on INT/WIS/CHA saves vs magic helps maintain concentration
- **Darkbolt + Reaction Denial:** Prevent enemy spellcasters from using Shield or Counterspell
- **Magic Missile + Shield:** Enemies can't use Shield to block Magic Missile if you deny reactions with Darkbolt first
- **Ink + Scouting:** Raven flies 50 ft, shares senses telepathically within 100 ft

**Note:** At level 5, Silas now has Animate Dead in his spellbook. However, undead minion kills do NOT trigger Grim Harvest - only kills from Silas's own spells trigger it. Will need to add Vampiric Touch or other necromancy damage spells to fully utilize Grim Harvest (3× spell level healing)

### Daily Routine (Level 5+)
1. **Choose spell preparation list** (see spells.md for details):
   - **Combat-Focused:** Includes Animate Dead, Counterspell, Darkbolt, Mirror Image
   - **Exploration-Focused:** Includes Counterspell and ritual spells for utility
2. **Maintain undead minions:** Cast Animate Dead to reassert control over up to 4 undead (24-hour duration, must recast daily)
   - Typically maintain 2 skeletons for combat (AC 13, HP 19, ranged/melee capable)
   - Can raise zombies instead for more HP (AC 8, HP 28, Undead Fortitude)
3. Cast Mage Armor after long rest (lasts 8 hours, no concentration)
4. Send Ink scouting ahead before entering dangerous areas (100 ft telepathic link, fly speed 50 ft)
5. Use Detect Magic ritual when investigating new locations (or cast as action if prepared)
6. Keep Find Familiar spell available to resummon Ink if needed (1 hour ritual or use spell slot)

## Character Optimization Notes

### Strengths (Level 5)
- **Undead Minions:** 2-4 animated skeletons/zombies provide frontline protection and extra actions in combat
- **Defensive Layering:** AC 15 base, +5 with Shield reaction, Mirror Image for misdirection, undead bodyguards
- **Concentration Protection:** Gnome Cunning gives advantage on saves vs magic
- **Spell Versatility:** Can prepare 9 spells, access to entire wizard spell list
- **Counterspell:** Can now block enemy spells, critical defensive tool
- **Sustain:** Grim Harvest healing + Arcane Recovery for spell slots (up to 3 levels)
- **Intelligence Skills:** +7 to Arcana, History, Investigation - excellent for Curse of Strahd mysteries
- **Action Economy:** Undead act on your bonus action, allowing you to cast spells and command minions same turn

### Weaknesses
- **Low HP:** 44 HP is better but still fragile - must avoid melee (rely on undead for frontline)
- **No AOE damage yet:** Sleep less effective at higher levels, still need Fireball for groups
- **Positioning Critical:** 25 ft movement (Gnome) means poor positioning is hard to fix even with Misty Step
- **Spell Slot Management:** 4/3/2 slots, must balance maintaining undead (1× 3rd level slot daily) with combat spells
- **Undead Maintenance:** Must cast Animate Dead daily or lose control of minions after 24 hours
- **Social Challenges:** Traveling with animated undead may cause problems in towns/settlements

### Background Choice: Sage ✓

**Why Sage?**
- **Researcher feature:** Access to libraries and learned individuals fits scholarly undertaker concept
- **Skills:** Arcana and History are both INT-based, synergizing with high Intelligence
- **Magic Initiate feat:** Granted 2 cantrips (Chill Touch, Toll the Dead) + Find Familiar (for Ink the raven)
- **Languages:** Two additional languages (Draconic, Infernal) support necromantic research theme

**How it connects to undertaker profession:**
- Silas is a **scholarly** undertaker, not just a practitioner
- Researches death magic, burial customs, and methods of preventing undeath
- Uses Researcher feature to access temple archives and necromantic texts

### Silas's Philosophy on Necromancy

**Core Belief: Extending Time and Life**
- Silas is obsessed with the concept of time and extending it beyond natural limits
- He views raising the dead NOT as desecration but as an **extension of life itself**
- Death is not an end but a transition - and through necromancy, that transition can be prolonged
- Animate Dead allows the deceased to continue serving purpose, preserving their existence through time
- This philosophy makes him a TRUE necromancer while maintaining his benevolent, Neutral Good alignment

**How This Affects Gameplay:**
- Silas regularly maintains 2-4 animated undead (skeletons or zombies) as companions
- He treats his undead respectfully, viewing them as extended versions of their former selves
- Uses Animate Dead as core combat strategy, positioning undead to protect himself and allies
- At level 6, Undead Thralls will significantly buff his minions (+10 HP, +2 damage)
- Combat role shifts to "Necromancer Controller" - commanding undead while casting spells from safety

**Key Questions for Character Development:**
1. **Curse of Strahd Integration:** How does Silas's view of "extending time" conflict with Barovia's curse where death is corrupted and souls are trapped?
2. **Moral Boundaries:** Will Silas raise ANY corpse, or does he still maintain ethical boundaries about who deserves extension?
3. **Combat Role Evolution:** As undead count increases (up to 4 at level 5, more at higher levels), how does this change party dynamics?
