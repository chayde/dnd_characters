# Silas Graves - Background & Story

## Background: Sage

Silas Graves is a scholarly undertaker who combined his profession with academic study of death and necromantic magic. He views death not as something to be exploited, but as a natural transition deserving respect, study, and reverence. His research into the nature of death and proper burial rites led him to formal magical training.

## Backstory

**[To be developed based on campaign needs and player preferences]**

### How Silas Became a Necromancer Wizard

As an undertaker, Silas was always surrounded by death - but he saw it as a sacred profession, not a morbid one. His intellectual curiosity led him to research magical methods of preservation and protection against undeath. Through self-study, he taught himself *Chill Touch* to ward off restless spirits and *Toll the Dead* as part of his understanding of death's finality. He summoned Ink, a raven familiar, both as a companion and as a traditional symbol of death.

Silas's natural aptitude for magic and his scholarly approach to understanding death caught the attention of [mentor/institution - to be determined]. His formal training in necromancy wasn't about raising armies of undead, but about understanding the transition between life and death, protecting the living from undeath, and preserving the dignity of the deceased.

He began keeping *The Final Ledger*, intertwining his spellbook with memorial records - each spell learned became connected to those he helped lay to rest, ensuring their memory lived on even as he grew in power.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Where did Silas train formally as a wizard? Was there a mentor?
- What event pushed him from peaceful scholar-undertaker to adventuring wizard?
