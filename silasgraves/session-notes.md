## Session: November 2, 2025

### Notes

#### Tarot Card Reading - Fortune Teller
The party encountered a fortune teller who provided a 5-card reading:

**Card 1 - Power and Strength (Weapon of Vengeance)**
- **Card Drawn:** Philanthropist (2 of Coins)
- **Meaning:** Charity and giving on a grand scale, those who use wealth to combat sickness
- **Clue:** "Look to a place where sickness and madness are bred, where children once cried. The treasure lies still."
- **Item:** A sword of light

**Card 2 - Force for Good and Protection (Holy Symbol)**
- **Card Drawn:** Abjurer (4 of Stars)
- **Meaning:** Those guided by logic and reasoning. Warns of an overlooked clue or piece of information.
- **Clue:** "I see a fallen house guarded by a great stone dragon, look to the highest peak."
- **Item:** A holy symbol of great hope

**Card 3 - History and Knowledge (Understanding the Enemy)**
- **Card Drawn:** Wizard (Master of Stars) - "Very curious"
- **Meaning:** Mystery and riddles, the unknown. Those who crave magical power and great knowledge.
- **Clue:** "Look for a wizard's tower, on a great lake. Let the wizard's name and servant guide you to that which you seek."
- **Item:** Knowledge of the ancients

**Card 4 - One Who Will Help (Ally)**
- **Card Drawn:** Ghost (King of Hearts)
- **Meaning:** A spiritual ally
- **Clue:** "Stir the spirit of the clumsy knight whose crypt lies deep within the castle."
- **Ally:** The clumsy knight's spirit

**Card 5 - Your Enemy (Creature of Darkness)**
- **Card Drawn:** Executioner (Man with eyes sewn shut in black robe, noose behind him)
- **Meaning:** Imminent death of one rightly or wrongly convicted. False accusations and unjust prosecution.
- **Vision:** The fortune teller's head turned east, staring past her tent. "I see a dark figure on a balcony overlooking the cliff. He looks down upon this tortured land and sees you, Vicente, with a twisted smile."
- **Location:** A balcony overlooking a cliff (eastern location)

#### Level 5 Advancement
The party reached level 5. Silas gained access to 3rd-level spells and chose:
- **Animate Dead** - To raise undead servants
- **Counterspell** - To defend against enemy spellcasters

#### The Durst Children - Rose and Thorn
Silas recovered the remains of two children from the Death House:
- **Rose Durst** - Daughter of the Durst family
- **Thorn Durst** - Son of the Durst family

Silas carries their bones and uses Animate Dead to raise them as skeletal servants. Consistent with his philosophy of extending time and preserving existence beyond natural death, Silas views this as giving the tragic children continued purpose. He maintains their animation daily and treats them with respect as companions rather than mere tools.

#### Combat: Defeating a Revenant
The party encountered and defeated an undead Revenant in combat. After the battle, Silas claimed the body for future use. The party has named this revenant "Mook."

Silas now animates Mook as a zombie using Animate Dead, adding a third undead companion to his retinue (maximum 4 at level 5).

**Current Undead Companions:**
1. Rose Durst (Skeleton)
2. Thorn Durst (Skeleton)
3. Mook (Zombie) - Former Revenant
