description: Begin character development session and review previous progress
---

You are beginning a new character development session for Silas Graves, the Level 4 Necromancy Wizard.

## Your Task

1. **Read the currentstatus.md file** to understand the full project history

2. **Analyze the most recent session** and identify:
   - What was accomplished in the last session
   - Key decisions that were made
   - Changes made to character files
   - Outstanding questions that need answers
   - Next steps that were planned

3. **Review the project context** by understanding:
   - Current state of the character build
   - Unresolved design decisions
   - Planned future developments

4. **Present a session briefing** to the user with the following structure:

```markdown
# Session Start - [Today's Date]

## Last Session Recap
[Brief 2-3 sentence summary of what was accomplished last time]

## Current Status
- **Character Level:** [level]
- **Recent Changes:** [highlight 1-2 most important recent changes]
- **Active Decisions:** [any decisions currently being worked on]

## Outstanding Questions
[List the key questions that still need answers, numbered]

## Suggested Next Steps
I see several things we could work on today:

1. **[Topic 1]** - [brief description of why this is important]
2. **[Topic 2]** - [brief description]
3. **[Topic 3]** - [brief description]

What would you like to focus on in this session?
```

## Important Instructions

- Be welcoming but concise - get the user oriented quickly
- Prioritize actionable next steps over historical details
- If there are urgent outstanding questions, highlight them
- Group related next steps together
- Present 3-5 concrete options for what to work on, based on the "Next Steps" from the last session
- Always end by asking the user what they want to focus on
- Use present tense for current status, past tense for previous session recap

## Special Cases

- If this is the very first session (no previous entries), welcome the user and ask what they want to work on
- If there are critical errors or inconsistencies noted in the last session, prioritize those
- If the user has specific "Next Steps" that are time-sensitive or blocking other work, highlight those first
