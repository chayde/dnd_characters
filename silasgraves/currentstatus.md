## Session December 28, 2025 - Level 7 Advancement & Combat Prep

### Date
December 28, 2025

### Session Summary
The character advanced from Level 6 to Level 7. We updated all core character files to reflect the new statistics, spell slots, and spell choices. We also prepared specific tactics for an ongoing combat encounter with Spiders and Driders.

### Key Decisions Made
- **Level 7 Spells Chosen:**
  - **Polymorph (4th):** Versatile offense/defense (Giant Ape / Turtle).
  - **Speak with Dead (3rd):** Thematic investigation tool.
- **HP Updated:** Increased to **51**.
- **Prepared Spells:** Increased limit to **11**. Lists updated to include *Polymorph*.
- **Undead Stats:** Updated Rose/Thorn/Mook HP to reflect Level 7 Wizard bonus (+7 HP).

### Changes to Character Files
- **spells.md:** Added Level 7 spells, updated Arcane Recovery (4 levels), updated prepared lists.
- **character-sheet.md:** Updated Level (7), HP (51), Spell Slots (4/3/3/1), Prepared Count (11), Undead HP.
- **combatblock.md:** Updated HP, Undead HP, added Level 7 tactics (Polymorph).
- **combatcheatsheet.md:** Refreshed for Level 7 and added specific "Spider/Drider" combat guide.
- **silasgraves.md:** Full refresh to Level 7 stats.
- **build-plan.md:** Updated plan to reflect Level 7 status.
- **session-notes.md:** Added entry for Level 7 and Spider combat.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Survive the Spider/Drider encounter using Fireball/Polymorph strategies.
- [ ] Use *Speak with Dead* on fallen enemies or discovered corpses to gather Barovian lore.
- [ ] Plan for Level 8 ASI (Intelligence to 20 vs. Feat).
