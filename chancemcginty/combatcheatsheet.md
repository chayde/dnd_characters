## Standard Turn Logic

### 1. The Approach (Mobility)
*   **40 ft Movement:** Use **Halfling Nimbleness** to run through the legs of the front line.
*   **Step of the Wind (Dash):** Bonus Action for **free** if you need 80 ft of movement.
*   **Patient Defense (Disengage):** Bonus Action for **free** if you need to escape melee without attacking.

### 2. The Strike (Action)
*   **Spear (Two-Handed):** 1d8+3. If hit, target has Disadvantage on next attack (**Sap**).
*   *Or* **Unarmed Strike:** 1d6+3.

### 3. The Pressure (Bonus Action - Cost: 1 Focus)
*   **Flurry of Blows:** Two Unarmed Strikes.
    *   **Hit 1:** Use **Addle** (Target can't take reactions) -> Allows you to move away safely.
    *   **Hit 2:** Use **Topple** (DEX Save or Prone) -> Gives allies Advantage.

### 4. The Defense (Reaction)
*   **Deflect Attack:** Reduce incoming damage (Melee or Ranged) by **1d10+6**.
    *   *Note:* If damage reduces to 0, spend 1 Focus to hit them back immediately.

## Tactical Reminders
*   **The Panic Button:** Use **Uncanny Metabolism** if you run out of Focus mid-fight. It heals you (~6 HP) and refills all 3 points.
*   **The Gambler's Edge:** Always use **Halfling Luck** to reroll 1s. Save your **Lucky Feat** points for saving throws or to negate a Critical Hit against you.
*   **Sap Synergy:** If you hit with the Spear, the enemy is **Sapped**. If you then **Dodge** (Patient Defense - 1 Focus), they are attacking with Disadvantage *twice* (Functionally impossible for them to hit you).
