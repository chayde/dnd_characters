## Standard Turn Logic

### 1. The Approach
*   Use **Halfling Nimbleness** to run through the legs of the front line.
*   Use **Step of the Wind (Dash)** for free if you need more than 35ft.

### 2. The Strike (Action)
*   **Spear (Two-Handed):** 1d8+3. If hit, target has Disadvantage on next attack (**Sap**).
*   *Or* **Unarmed Strike:** 1d6+3.

### 3. The Pressure (Bonus Action)
*   **Flurry of Blows (1 Focus):** Two Unarmed Strikes.
    *   **Hit 1:** Use **Addle** (Target can't take reactions) -> Allows you to move away safely.
    *   **Hit 2:** Use **Topple** (DEX Save or Prone) -> Gives allies Advantage.

### 4. The Defense (Reaction)
*   **Deflect Attack:** Reduce incoming damage. Catch the punch and smile.

## Tactical Reminders
*   **The Gambler's Edge:** Always use **Halfling Luck** to reroll 1s. Save your **Lucky Feat** points for saving throws or to force a boss to miss a big hit.
*   **Hit and Run:** If you use **Addle**, you don't need to disengage. Use your movement to get behind a larger ally (naturally stealthy) or out of range.
*   **Sap Synergy:** If you hit with the Spear, the enemy is **Sapped**. If you then **Dodge** (Patient Defense), they are attacking with Disadvantage *twice* (Functionally impossible for them to hit you).
