## 📜 Character Concept & Backstory

**"The Codex says you are standing in a statistically probable blast zone. You should move."**

### The Grunt Who Found a God
Klaus was never meant to be a wizard. He was a **heavy infantryman**—a rank-and-file soldier trained to hold the line, follow orders, and endure the mud and blood of siege warfare. He wasn't a hero; he was "reliable." He wore chainmail like a second skin and marched until his boots fell apart.

His life changed during the **Siege of Harrow's Peak**. His unit was decimated by arcane traps, and Klaus, the sole survivor, tumbled into a buried, sealed archive beneath the enemy tower. There, amidst the dust and silence, he found it: **The Tacticus Arcanum** (or simply, "The Codex").

### The Unlikely Apprentice
The Codex was a sentient grimoire belonging to a legendary, long-dead Archmage of War. It had waited centuries for a worthy apprentice—a prodigy of intellect and grace. Instead, it got Klaus.

Desperate to escape the ruins, Klaus opened the book, and the Codex, sensing raw potential (and desperation), unlocked a fraction of its power. It taught the grunt to cast a *Fire Bolt* not with a wand, but with the same muscle memory as firing a crossbow. It taught him that a *Shield* spell is just a better pavise.

### The Dynamics
*   **Klaus:** Approaches magic with soldierly pragmatism. He doesn't "weave the arcane"; he "fires for effect." He wears his old service armor because robes are for people who haven't been stabbed. He carries a sword because it doesn't run out of spell slots.
*   **The Codex:** A demanding, haughty, and brilliant instructor living in his head (and book). It constantly critiques his form and "crude" application of complex theorems.
    *   *Codex:* "You must visualize the ethereal vectors!"
    *   *Klaus:* "I'm just going to burn the door down."
    *   *Codex:* *Sighs psychically.* "Very well. But adjust for windage."

**Why He Adventures:** The Codex is guiding him. It claims Klaus needs "field data" to refine his technique, but Klaus suspects the book has a larger goal—perhaps its own resurrection or the defeat of an ancient rival. Klaus follows because he's tasted power, and he's never going back to digging latrines.
