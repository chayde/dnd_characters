## Appearance & Personality

### Vesper's Appearance

**Physique:**
Vesper stands unusually short for an Aasimar, barely reaching **4 feet in height**. Their frame is slight and bird-like, appearing fragile enough to be swept away by a strong wind. This small stature often causes enemies to underestimate the sheer cosmic force contained within.

**Skin & Markings:**
Their skin is the color of **pale, polished marble**, cool to the touch. Instead of typical scars or freckles, **silvery, metallic tattoos** trace complex star charts and constellations across their arms, neck, and face. These markings do not look inked but rather like veins of quicksilver beneath the skin, catching the light even in dim rooms.

**Eyes:**
Vesper’s eyes are **featureless pools of deep, twilight violet**. There are no pupils or irises, just an endless, captivating void. When they cast a spell or tap into their Starry Form, tiny pinpricks of white light appear within the violet, mimicking the night sky.

**Hair:**
Their hair is **shoulder-length and bone-white**, appearing weightless. It tends to float slightly around them as if suspended in zero gravity, reacting to magical currents rather than the wind.

**Attire:**
They wear **worn, practical leathers** dyed in deep indigos and blacks, blending into the shadows. Over this, a heavy cloak made of **tattered grey wool** is fastened with a brooch made from a shard of fallen meteorite. The "Star Map" focus is not a scroll, but a **sphere of dark crystal** (or perhaps a complex astrolabe) that they manipulate with their fingers, the silvery tattoos on their hands seemingly interacting with the object.

**The Transformation (Radiant Consumption):**
When Vesper unleashes their Scourge power, the transformation is terrifyingly beautiful.
*   The silvery tattoos **erupt with blinding white light**, searing the air around them.
*   The light doesn't just glow; it *burns*, causing their skin to crack and peel like a breaking ceramic shell, revealing pure energy beneath.
*   Their eyes go completely white, and their voice echoes with the harmonic, deafening hum of a dying star.
*   It looks painful—a vessel too small containing too much power—reinforcing the "Scourge" aspect.
