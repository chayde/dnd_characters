## 🪄 Magic Item Tricks
*   **Staff of the Woodlands:**
    *   *Pass Without Trace:* Cast at will. Never turn this off unless you are concentrating on combat spells.
    *   *Wall of Thorns:* You have 6 charges. This costs 6 charges. You can cast this ONCE per day. Make it count. It creates a 60ft long, 10ft high, 5ft thick wall.
*   **Sentinel Shield:**
    *   You have Advantage on Initiative. You will likely go first. Don't panic; set up the battlefield.
*   **Radiant Consumption (Aasimar):**
    *   Don't forget this hurts YOU (5 dmg/turn). Use *Absorb Elements* (if you had it) or just tank it with your high HP. Be careful not to kill unconscious allies with the aura!

## ⚠️ "Oh No" Situations
*   **"I'm surrounded!"** -> *Thunderwave* (if prepped) or Disengage + Fly (Dragon Form).
*   **"The Boss is regenerating!"** -> *Moonbeam* or *Guiding Bolt* (Radiant stops many regenerations).
*   **"We need to run!"** -> *Plant Growth* behind you (slows them down massive) + *Pass Without Trace* (hide).
